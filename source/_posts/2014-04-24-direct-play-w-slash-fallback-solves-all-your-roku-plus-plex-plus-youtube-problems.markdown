I'm a [cord cutter](http://www.techopedia.com/definition/28547/cord-cutting)
and have relied heavily on a combination of [Roku](http://roku.com),
[Plex](http://plex.tv), and the Plex [YouTube](http://youtube.com) channel
for both entertainment and work-related content for the past couple of
years. So far it has been an okay experience but I've had ongoing problems
with YouTube streams crapping out mid-play. I finally took the time
to track down a solution and here's what has worked for me:

1. Go to your Roku's Plex channel.
1. Scroll all the way to the bottom of the Plex channel interface and 
select 'Preferences'.
1. Scroll down to the "Direct Play" section and select
"Direct Play w/ Fallback".

This seems to have not only solved my problems with YouTube streaming but
similar problems when streaming local media hosted on a Plex Media Server.

Hope that helps.
